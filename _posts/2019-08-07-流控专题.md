# ReteLimiter

```
//com.google.common.util.concurrent.SmoothRateLimiter 注释翻译
/*
 * How is the RateLimiter designed, and why?
 *令牌桶是怎么设计的，为什么要这么设计？
 * The primary feature of a RateLimiter is its "stable rate", the maximum rate that
 * is should allow at normal conditions. This is enforced by "throttling" incoming
 * requests as needed, i.e. compute, for an incoming request, the appropriate throttle    time,
 * and make the calling thread wait as much.
 *
 
 * The simplest way to maintain a rate of QPS is to keep the timestamp of the last
 * granted request, and ensure that (1/QPS) seconds have elapsed since then. For example,
 * for a rate of QPS=5 (5 tokens per second), if we ensure that a request isn't granted
 * earlier than 200ms after the last one, then we achieve the intended rate.
 * If a request comes and the last request was granted only 100ms ago, then we wait for
 * another 100ms. At this rate, serving 15 fresh permits (i.e. for an acquire(15) request)
 * naturally takes 3 seconds.
 *
 * It is important to realize that such a RateLimiter has a very superficial memory
 * of the past: it only remembers the last request. What if the RateLimiter was unused for
 * a long period of time, then a request arrived and was immediately granted?
 * This RateLimiter would immediately forget about that past underutilization. This may
 * result in either underutilization or overflow, depending on the real world consequences
 * of not using the expected rate.
 *
 * Past underutilization could mean that excess resources are available. Then, the RateLimiter
 * should speed up for a while, to take advantage of these resources. This is important
 * when the rate is applied to networking (limiting bandwidth), where past underutilization
 * typically translates to "almost empty buffers", which can be filled immediately.
 *
 * On the other hand, past underutilization could mean that "the server responsible for
 * handling the request has become less ready for future requests", i.e. its caches become
 * stale, and requests become more likely to trigger expensive operations (a more extreme
 * case of this example is when a server has just booted, and it is mostly busy with getting
 * itself up to speed).
 *
 * To deal with such scenarios, we add an extra dimension, that of "past underutilization",
 * modeled by "storedPermits" variable. This variable is zero when there is no
 * underutilization, and it can grow up to maxStoredPermits, for sufficiently large
 * underutilization. So, the requested permits, by an invocation acquire(permits),
 * are served from:
 * - stored permits (if available)
 * - fresh permits (for any remaining permits)
 *
 * How this works is best explained with an example:
 *
 * For a RateLimiter that produces 1 token per second, every second
 * that goes by with the RateLimiter being unused, we increase storedPermits by 1.
 * Say we leave the RateLimiter unused for 10 seconds (i.e., we expected a request at time
 * X, but we are at time X + 10 seconds before a request actually arrives; this is
 * also related to the point made in the last paragraph), thus storedPermits
 * becomes 10.0 (assuming maxStoredPermits >= 10.0). At that point, a request of acquire(3)
 * arrives. We serve this request out of storedPermits, and reduce that to 7.0 (how this is
 * translated to throttling time is discussed later). Immediately after, assume that an
 * acquire(10) request arriving. We serve the request partly from storedPermits,
 * using all the remaining 7.0 permits, and the remaining 3.0, we serve them by fresh permits
 * produced by the rate limiter.
 *
 * We already know how much time it takes to serve 3 fresh permits: if the rate is
 * "1 token per second", then this will take 3 seconds. But what does it mean to serve 7
 * stored permits? As explained above, there is no unique answer. If we are primarily
 * interested to deal with underutilization, then we want stored permits to be given out
 * /faster/ than fresh ones, because underutilization = free resources for the taking.
 * If we are primarily interested to deal with overflow, then stored permits could
 * be given out /slower/ than fresh ones. Thus, we require a (different in each case)
 * function that translates storedPermits to throtting time.
 *
 * This role is played by storedPermitsToWaitTime(double storedPermits, double permitsToTake).
 * The underlying model is a continuous function mapping storedPermits
 * (from 0.0 to maxStoredPermits) onto the 1/rate (i.e. intervals) that is effective at the given
 * storedPermits. "storedPermits" essentially measure unused time; we spend unused time
 * buying/storing permits. Rate is "permits / time", thus "1 / rate = time / permits".
 * Thus, "1/rate" (time / permits) times "permits" gives time, i.e., integrals on this
 * function (which is what storedPermitsToWaitTime() computes) correspond to minimum intervals
 * between subsequent requests, for the specified number of requested permits.
 *
 * Here is an example of storedPermitsToWaitTime:
 * If storedPermits == 10.0, and we want 3 permits, we take them from storedPermits,
 * reducing them to 7.0, and compute the throttling for these as a call to
 * storedPermitsToWaitTime(storedPermits = 10.0, permitsToTake = 3.0), which will
 * evaluate the integral of the function from 7.0 to 10.0.
 *
 * Using integrals guarantees that the effect of a single acquire(3) is equivalent
 * to { acquire(1); acquire(1); acquire(1); }, or { acquire(2); acquire(1); }, etc,
 * since the integral of the function in [7.0, 10.0] is equivalent to the sum of the
 * integrals of [7.0, 8.0], [8.0, 9.0], [9.0, 10.0] (and so on), no matter
 * what the function is. This guarantees that we handle correctly requests of varying weight
 * (permits), /no matter/ what the actual function is - so we can tweak the latter freely.
 * (The only requirement, obviously, is that we can compute its integrals).
 *
 * Note well that if, for this function, we chose a horizontal line, at height of exactly
 * (1/QPS), then the effect of the function is non-existent: we serve storedPermits at
 * exactly the same cost as fresh ones (1/QPS is the cost for each). We use this trick later.
 *
 * If we pick a function that goes /below/ that horizontal line, it means that we reduce
 * the area of the function, thus time. Thus, the RateLimiter becomes /faster/ after a
 * period of underutilization. If, on the other hand, we pick a function that
 * goes /above/ that horizontal line, then it means that the area (time) is increased,
 * thus storedPermits are more costly than fresh permits, thus the RateLimiter becomes
 * /slower/ after a period of underutilization.
 *
 * Last, but not least: consider a RateLimiter with rate of 1 permit per second, currently
 * completely unused, and an expensive acquire(100) request comes. It would be nonsensical
 * to just wait for 100 seconds, and /then/ start the actual task. Why wait without doing
 * anything? A much better approach is to /allow/ the request right away (as if it was an
 * acquire(1) request instead), and postpone /subsequent/ requests as needed. In this version,
 * we allow starting the task immediately, and postpone by 100 seconds future requests,
 * thus we allow for work to get done in the meantime instead of waiting idly.
 *
 * This has important consequences: it means that the RateLimiter doesn't remember the time
 * of the _last_ request, but it remembers the (expected) time of the _next_ request. This
 * also enables us to tell immediately (see tryAcquire(timeout)) whether a particular
 * timeout is enough to get us to the point of the next scheduling time, since we always
 * maintain that. And what we mean by "an unused RateLimiter" is also defined by that
 * notion: when we observe that the "expected arrival time of the next request" is actually
 * in the past, then the difference (now - past) is the amount of time that the RateLimiter
 * was formally unused, and it is that amount of time which we translate to storedPermits.
 * (We increase storedPermits with the amount of permits that would have been produced
 * in that idle time). So, if rate == 1 permit per second, and arrivals come exactly
 * one second after the previous, then storedPermits is _never_ increased -- we would only
 * increase it for arrivals _later_ than the expected one second.

/**
 * This implements the following function:
 *
 *          ^ throttling
 *          |

 *   stable +----------/  WARM . }
 * interval |          .   UP  . } <-- this rectangle (from 0 to maxPermits, and
 *          |          . PERIOD. }     height == stableInterval) defines the cooldown period,
 *          |          .       . }     and we want cooldownPeriod == warmupPeriod
 *          |---------------------------------> storedPermits
 *              (halfPermits) (maxPermits)
 *
 * Before going into the details of this particular function, let's keep in mind the basics:
 * 1) The state of the RateLimiter (storedPermits) is a vertical line in this figure.
 * 2) When the RateLimiter is not used, this goes right (up to maxPermits)
 * 3) When the RateLimiter is used, this goes left (down to zero), since if we have storedPermits,
 *    we serve from those first
 * 4) When _unused_, we go right at the same speed (rate)! I.e., if our rate is
 *    2 permits per second, and 3 unused seconds pass, we will always save 6 permits
 *    (no matter what our initial position was), up to maxPermits.
 *    If we invert the rate, we get the "stableInterval" (interval between two requests
 *    in a perfectly spaced out sequence of requests of the given rate). Thus, if you
 *    want to see "how much time it will take to go from X storedPermits to X+K storedPermits?",
 *    the answer is always stableInterval * K. In the same example, for 2 permits per second,
 *    stableInterval is 500ms. Thus to go from X storedPermits to X+6 storedPermits, we
 *    require 6 * 500ms = 3 seconds.
 *
 *    In short, the time it takes to move to the right (save K permits) is equal to the
 *    rectangle of width == K and height == stableInterval.
 * 4) When _used_, the time it takes, as explained in the introductory class note, is
 *    equal to the integral of our function, between X permits and X-K permits, assuming
 *    we want to spend K saved permits.
 *
 *    In summary, the time it takes to move to the left (spend K permits), is equal to the
 *    area of the function of width == K.
 *
 * Let's dive into this function now:
 *
 * When we have storedPermits <= halfPermits (the left portion of the function), then
 * we spend them at the exact same rate that
 * fresh permits would be generated anyway (that rate is 1/stableInterval). We size
 * this area to be equal to _half_ the specified warmup period. Why we need this?
 * And why half? We'll explain shortly below (after explaining the second part).
 *
 * Stored permits that are beyond halfPermits, are mapped to an ascending line, that goes
 * from stableInterval to 3 * stableInterval. The average height for that part is
 * 2 * stableInterval, and is sized appropriately to have an area _equal_ to the
 * specified warmup period. Thus, by point (4) above, it takes "warmupPeriod" amount of time
 * to go from maxPermits to halfPermits.
 *
 * BUT, by point (3) above, it only takes "warmupPeriod / 2" amount of time to return back
 * to maxPermits, from halfPermits! (Because the trapezoid has double the area of the rectangle
 * of height stableInterval and equivalent width). We decided that the "cooldown period"
 * time should be equivalent to "warmup period", thus a fully saturated RateLimiter
 * (with zero stored permits, serving only fresh ones) can go to a fully unsaturated
 * (with storedPermits == maxPermits) in the same amount of time it takes for a fully
 * unsaturated RateLimiter to return to the stableInterval -- which happens in halfPermits,
 * since beyond that point, we use a horizontal line of "stableInterval" height, simulating
 * the regular rate.
 *
 * Thus, we have figured all dimensions of this shape, to give all the desired
 * properties:
 * - the width is warmupPeriod / stableInterval, to make cooldownPeriod == warmupPeriod
 * - the slope starts at the middle, and goes from stableInterval to 3*stableInterval so
 *   to have halfPermits being spend in double the usual time (half the rate), while their
 *   respective rate is steadily ramping up

1. RateLimiter 是令牌桶限速器，由google的Guava框架提供，如每秒1个令牌桶，分别请求时间是1S 2.05S 3S，则令牌桶拿到令牌的时间是1S 2.05S 3.05S。

2. RateLimiter是会计算出下一次获取令牌的时间，有队列存放请求的线程吗 （阻塞队列）

   采用的synchronized来控制并发。没有显示的阻塞队列，线程阻塞挂起，在监视器的阻塞队列里，随机唤醒线程，不公平的。 

   

   扩展：

   1. **TPS**：Transactions Per Second（每秒传输的事务处理个数），即服务器每秒处理的事务数。TPS包括一条消息入和一条消息出，加上一次用户数据库访问。TPS是软件测试结果的测量单位。一个事务是指一个客户机向服务器发送请求然后服务器做出反应的过程。客户机在发送请求时开始计时，收到服务器响应后结束计时，以此来计算使用的时间和完成的事务个数。
   2. **QPS**：每秒查询率QPS是对一个特定的查询服务器在规定时间内所处理流量多少的衡量标准，在因特网上，作为域名系统服务器的机器的性能经常用每秒查询率来衡量。对应fetches/sec，即每秒的响应请求数，也即是最大吞吐能力。

### 使用

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
    RateLimiter rateLimiter = RateLimiter.create(5);//采用的Bursty而不是WarmingUp
    ThreadPoolExecutor pools = new ThreadPoolExecutor(30, 30, 1000L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS,
            new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(10));
    for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
        pools.submit(() -> {
            System.out.println(rateLimiter.acquire());
        });
    }
}
```

com.google.common.util.concurrent.RateLimiter#create(com.google.common.util.concurrent.RateLimiter.SleepingStopwatch, double)

```java
@VisibleForTesting
static RateLimiter create(SleepingStopwatch stopwatch, double permitsPerSecond) {
  RateLimiter rateLimiter = new SmoothBursty(stopwatch, 1.0 /* maxBurstSeconds */);
  rateLimiter.setRate(permitsPerSecond);
  return rateLimiter;
}
```

两种模式：

SmoothBursty 突发，不设置阈值thresholdPermits，之前很久没有请求令牌，存储的令牌storedPermits大于此次请求的令牌数，当请求令牌数大于阈值，无需等待。

SmoothWarmingUp 预热，请求令牌数大于阈值的部分需要等待差值对应的时间长度。



#### **预热模式**

com.google.common.util.concurrent.SmoothRateLimiter.SmoothWarmingUp

##### RateLimiter#create

冷却因子  coldFactory=3.0 （硬编码，）warmupPeriod要求大于等于0

```java
//com.google.common.util.concurrent.RateLimiter#create(double, long, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)
    
public static RateLimiter create(double permitsPerSecond, long warmupPeriod, TimeUnit unit) {
  checkArgument(warmupPeriod >= 0, "warmupPeriod must not be negative: %s", warmupPeriod);
  return create(SleepingStopwatch.createFromSystemTimer(), permitsPerSecond, warmupPeriod, unit,
                3.0);
    //冷却因子3.0 ，是stableInterval的三倍，硬编码的
}
//内部构造器
@VisibleForTesting
static RateLimiter create(
    SleepingStopwatch stopwatch, double permitsPerSecond, long warmupPeriod, TimeUnit unit,
    double coldFactor) {
    RateLimiter rateLimiter = new SmoothWarmingUp(stopwatch, warmupPeriod, unit, coldFactor);
    rateLimiter.setRate(permitsPerSecond);
    return rateLimiter;
}

```





##### RateLimiter#setRate

初始化或者改变速率是调用

```java
//com.google.common.util.concurrent.RateLimiter#setRate
public final void setRate(double permitsPerSecond) {
    checkArgument(
        permitsPerSecond > 0.0 && !Double.isNaN(permitsPerSecond), "rate must be positive");
    synchronized (mutex()) {
        doSetRate(permitsPerSecond, stopwatch.readMicros());
    }
}
//com.google.common.util.concurrent.SmoothRateLimiter#doSetRate(double, long)
@Override
final void doSetRate(double permitsPerSecond, long nowMicros) {
  resync(nowMicros);
  double stableIntervalMicros = SECONDS.toMicros(1L) / permitsPerSecond;
  this.stableIntervalMicros = stableIntervalMicros;
  doSetRate(permitsPerSecond, stableIntervalMicros);//调上面的
    //即com.google.common.util.concurrent.SmoothRateLimiter.SmoothWarmingUp#doSetRate
}

```



![1596620422542](.\../img/1596620422542.png)







##### SmoothWarmingUp#doSetRate

有一个关键点，从thresholdPermits到0的时间，是从maxPermits到thresholdPermits时间的一半，即长变形面积是梯形面积的一半（约定）。

maxPermits是横坐标的最右侧，这里的对应的纵坐标是Cold Interval=stableIntervalMicros*3

```java
//com.google.common.util.concurrent.SmoothRateLimiter.SmoothWarmingUp#doSetRate
 @Override
void doSetRate(double permitsPerSecond, double stableIntervalMicros) {
    double oldMaxPermits = maxPermits;
    //硬编码 coldIntervalMicros固定是stableIntervalMicros*3
    double coldIntervalMicros = stableIntervalMicros * coldFactor;
    //获取thresholdPermits所用时间（长变形面积）= warmupPeriodMicros（梯形面积）的一半 
    //约定： 梯形面积（warmupPeriodMicros）是长方形面积（thresholdPermits所用时间）的两倍
    thresholdPermits = 0.5 * warmupPeriodMicros / stableIntervalMicros;
    maxPermits = thresholdPermits //WarmingUp模式下maxPermits（固定不变，SmoothBursty也是不变的，并且等于1s产生的许可数）
        + 2.0 * warmupPeriodMicros / (stableIntervalMicros + coldIntervalMicros);
    slope = (coldIntervalMicros - stableIntervalMicros) / (maxPermits - thresholdPermits);
    if (oldMaxPermits == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY) {
        // if we don't special-case this, we would get storedPermits == NaN, below
        storedPermits = 0.0;
    } else {
        storedPermits = (oldMaxPermits == 0.0)
            ? maxPermits // initial state is cold
            : storedPermits * maxPermits / oldMaxPermits;
    }
}
```



![7](./..\img\7.png)

##### 公式：

```java
warmupPeriod = 2 * stableInterval * thresholdPermits // 隐含条件,硬编码
thresholdPermits = 0.5 * warmupPeriod / stableInterval // 注： 分界点

maxPermits = thresholdPermits + 2.0 * warmupPeriod / (stableInterval + coldInterval) //得出最大maxPermits 
```



#### 非预热模式SmoothBursty

com.google.common.util.concurrent.SmoothRateLimiter.SmoothBursty



```java
public static RateLimiter create(double permitsPerSecond) {
/*
* The default RateLimiter configuration can save the unused permits of up to one second.
* This is to avoid unnecessary stalls in situations like this: A RateLimiter of 1qps,
* and 4 threads, all calling acquire() at these moments:
*
* T0 at 0 seconds
* T1 at 1.05 seconds
* T2 at 2 seconds
* T3 at 3 seconds
*
* Due to the slight delay of T1, T2 would have to sleep till 2.05 seconds,
* and T3 would also have to sleep till 3.05 seconds.
*/
return create(SleepingStopwatch.createFromSystemTimer(), permitsPerSecond);
}
@VisibleForTesting
static RateLimiter create(SleepingStopwatch stopwatch, double permitsPerSecond) {
    RateLimiter rateLimiter = new SmoothBursty(stopwatch, 1.0 /* maxBurstSeconds */);
    rateLimiter.setRate(permitsPerSecond);
    return rateLimiter;
}
//这里主要看非预热模式最大permits 是怎么得来的   
//maxPermits = maxBurstSeconds * permitsPerSecond;
static final class SmoothBursty extends SmoothRateLimiter {
    /** The work (permits) of how many seconds can be saved up if this RateLimiter is unused? */
    final double maxBurstSeconds;

    SmoothBursty(SleepingStopwatch stopwatch, double maxBurstSeconds) {
        super(stopwatch);
        this.maxBurstSeconds = maxBurstSeconds;
    }
    //com.google.common.util.concurrent.SmoothRateLimiter.SmoothBursty#doSetRate
    @Override
    void doSetRate(double permitsPerSecond, double stableIntervalMicros) {
        double oldMaxPermits = this.maxPermits; 
        maxPermits = maxBurstSeconds * permitsPerSecond; //maxBurstSeconds 默认1 不变？
        if (oldMaxPermits == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY) {
            // if we don't special-case this, we would get storedPermits == NaN, below
            storedPermits = maxPermits;
        } else {
            storedPermits = (oldMaxPermits == 0.0)
                ? 0.0 // initial state
                : storedPermits * maxPermits / oldMaxPermits;
        }
    }
}
```

### 原理分析

#### acquire 令牌数不足需等待

```java
public double acquire(int permits) {
  long microsToWait = reserve(permits);//计算等待时间
  stopwatch.sleepMicrosUninterruptibly(microsToWait);
  return 1.0 * microsToWait / SECONDS.toMicros(1L);
}
```

#### tryAcquire 令牌数不足无需等待、或者等待指定时间

```java
public boolean tryAcquire(int permits, long timeout, TimeUnit unit) {
  long timeoutMicros = max(unit.toMicros(timeout), 0);
  checkPermits(permits);
  long microsToWait;
  synchronized (mutex()) {
    long nowMicros = stopwatch.readMicros();
    if (!canAcquire(nowMicros, timeoutMicros)) {
      return false;
    } else {
      microsToWait = reserveAndGetWaitLength(permits, nowMicros);
    }
  }
  stopwatch.sleepMicrosUninterruptibly(microsToWait);
  return true;
}
```

####  reserve

这里控制了多线程的并发，采用synchronized对对象加锁来控制多线程的并发

```java
//计算预留的时长，需要sleep的时长
//com.google.common.util.concurrent.RateLimiter#reserve
final long reserve(int permits) {
  checkPermits(permits);
  synchronized (mutex()) {
    return reserveAndGetWaitLength(permits, stopwatch.readMicros());
  }
} 
```

```java
//计算预留的时长，需要sleep的时长
final long reserveAndGetWaitLength(int permits, long nowMicros) {
  long momentAvailable = reserveEarliestAvailable(permits, nowMicros);
  return max(momentAvailable - nowMicros, 0);
}
```

#### SmoothRateLimiter

这里是重点,这个是抽象类，有两个实现类，com.google.common.util.concurrent.SmoothRateLimiter.SmoothBursty

com.google.common.util.concurrent.SmoothRateLimiter.SmoothWarmingUp

```java
abstract class SmoothRateLimiter extends RateLimiter{
  @Override
  final long reserveEarliestAvailable(int requiredPermits, long nowMicros) {
    resync(nowMicros);
    long returnValue = nextFreeTicketMicros;
    double storedPermitsToSpend = min(requiredPermits, this.storedPermits);
    double freshPermits = requiredPermits - storedPermitsToSpend;
    long waitMicros = storedPermitsToWaitTime(this.storedPermits, storedPermitsToSpend)
        + (long) (freshPermits * stableIntervalMicros);

    try {
      this.nextFreeTicketMicros = LongMath.checkedAdd(nextFreeTicketMicros, waitMicros);
    } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
      this.nextFreeTicketMicros = Long.MAX_VALUE;
    }
    this.storedPermits -= storedPermitsToSpend;
    return returnValue;
  }
 //每次调用的时候都会继续计算，惰性计算令牌,这个方法比较重要，首先会进行惰性计算
   // com.google.common.util.concurrent.SmoothRateLimiter#resync
  void resync(long nowMicros) {
    // if nextFreeTicket is in the past, resync to now
    if (nowMicros > nextFreeTicketMicros) {
        //存储permits 去min(),若超过了maxPermits 则丢掉超过的部分，
        //比如好久都没有消费令牌，令牌堆积如山，这个时候有消费线程来计算，直接把操作maxPermits的permit丢掉
      storedPermits = min(maxPermits,
          storedPermits
            + (nowMicros - nextFreeTicketMicros) / coolDownIntervalMicros());
        //直接设置下一次获取的时间在now之后
      nextFreeTicketMicros = nowMicros;
    }
  }
}
```



```java
@Override
void doSetRate(double permitsPerSecond, double stableIntervalMicros) {
  double oldMaxPermits = maxPermits;
  double coldIntervalMicros = stableIntervalMicros * coldFactor;
  thresholdPermits = 0.5 * warmupPeriodMicros / stableIntervalMicros;
  maxPermits = thresholdPermits
      + 2.0 * warmupPeriodMicros / (stableIntervalMicros + coldIntervalMicros);
  slope = (coldIntervalMicros - stableIntervalMicros) / (maxPermits - thresholdPermits);
  if (oldMaxPermits == Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY) {
    // if we don't special-case this, we would get storedPermits == NaN, below
    storedPermits = 0.0;
  } else {
    storedPermits = (oldMaxPermits == 0.0)
        ? maxPermits // initial state is cold
        : storedPermits * maxPermits / oldMaxPermits;
  }
}
```



#### 总结

涉及到的几个领域模型属性：

```java
/**  The interval between two unit requests, at our stable rate. E.g., a stable rate of 5 permits per second has a stable interval of 200ms. */
double stableIntervalMicros;
```

maxPermits 允许最大的令牌数，可配置?

storedPermits 存储的令牌数 

nextFreeTicketMicros 下一个免费令牌时间

storedPermitsToSpend 存储来消费的许可

requiredPermits 请求的许可

#####  nextFreeTicketMicros

该属性记下下一次可以获取令牌的开始时间。

比如QPS是5 次/秒，只需要确保两次请求时间经过了200ms即可，如果刚好在100ms到达，一次性需要15个令牌，需要的时间为为3s，惰性计算storedPermits令牌桶只有1个令牌，还需要14个令牌，就会再等待2800ms。注意：这种方式采取的是Bursty方式，不进行阈值的控制。

但是对于一个长时间没有请求的系统，这样的的设计方式有一定的不合理之处。考虑一个场景：如果一个RateLimiter,每秒产生1个令牌,它一直没有使用过，突然来了一个需要100个令牌的请求，选择等待100s再执行这个请求，显得不太明智，更好的处理方式为立即执行它，然后把接下来的请求推迟100s，采用了令牌桶storedPermits + 惰性计算来解决。

因而RateLimiter本身并不记下最后一次请求的时间，而是记下下一次能获取令牌的开始时间。（nextFreeTicketMicros）
